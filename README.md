# Fire-Safety-IoT-System
An IoT system capable to detect fire according to the Gaz level, temperature and light intensity.
The system is composed of:
- Arduino board
- Breadboard
- Gaz sensor
- Temperature sensor
- Photoresistor
- Buzzer
- LCD and Potentiometer
- LED red and LED green
- Wires

The system triggers buzzer and an red led in cas of gaz level >= 300, temperature >= 50 and light intensity hight. Then finally print an alert message on the LCD.
